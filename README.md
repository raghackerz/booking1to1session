#Steps to install dependencies.

#Steps to make your component.

- make a folder with name of your component inside src/components/.

- inside it create two files index.js and {yourComonentName}.css

- import your css file in index.js of your component

- After making your components push your changes.

#Conventions

- follow all the react conventions (like camel casing, first letter should be capital in naming components, use className instead of class, htmlFor instead of for, etc).

- follow BEM naming in css.

- paste all the images in src/assets/ folder and use descriptive names so that there will be no name collisions.

- remove any css code that modifies body, root or html.

- These will be helpful in debugging.
